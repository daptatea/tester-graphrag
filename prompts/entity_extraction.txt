-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is English. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is English., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

text:
, that the value of the property be materially affected by the existence of the defects. When any house has been lived in for years, as had this one, it is likely that a close inspection would reveal a number of conditions which could be termed "defects” by some, but that is not sufficient by itself to establish that the value of the property has been materially affected and to justify rescission. In the analogous contract situation, a breach of contract must be material in order to warrant rescission. Barber v. Rochester, 52 Wn.2d 691, 694, 328 P.2d 711 (1958); 17 Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 504 (1964). So it is in this tort action also, that for vendees to make out a case of constructive fraud by nondisclosure of defects in the property sold, the vendees must establish that the defects are material. See Klos v. Gockel
