-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English". as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English"., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

Blake, J.
Plaintiffs brought this action against the city of Seattle to recover for damage to property owned by them at the northeast corner of Fairview avenue and Shelby street. The damage was caused by the sliding of earth from Shelby street onto the property.
Eastlake avenue is parallel with, and a block east of, Fairview. Shelby street has never been improved. The slope of Shelby street descending to Fairview is 27% for the first half block and 20% for the rest of the way. When Eastlake avenue was improved, the city made a fill extending into Shelby street for about twenty feet. A drain was laid through this fill to carry off surface water that accumulated in a depression in the pavement on Eastlake.
In 1939, this fill was augmented and extended for an additional twenty feet by the encroachment of earth dumped by certain persons on the lot at the southwest corner of Eastlake and Shelby. In the early part of 1940, the entire
