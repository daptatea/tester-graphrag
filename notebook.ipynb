Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wn.2d 22, 28, 515 P.2d 160 (1973). The court reasoned that \"[a]ny realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant's promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord's promise to provide a liveable dwelling.\" Foisy, at 27.

       "195  Roe, J.\\nPlaintiff was a tenant in a house owned by defendant Detty. (Martin Detty will be referred to, in this opinion, as the sole defendant.) During a long rain, water leaked in around a window, and some collected on the floor. Plaintiff immediately reported this to the defendant and requested that it be repaired. The defendant-landlord twice, within a week of being notified, attempted but failed to locate and remedy the problem. About 2 weeks after giving notice of this condition, the plaintiff slipped in some water and sustained the injuries of which she complains in this action. About 2 weeks after her fall; the defendant succeeded in finding and repairing the leak. The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant.\\nThe Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18, modified the common law so as to require decent, safe and sanitary housing. RCW 59.18.040(4). It also requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in reasonably weathertight condition. RCW 59.18.060(8). Th...   \n",
       "777   unfair practices and competition language of RCW 19.86.020 was intentionally drawn with a broad brush to cover a broad range of human inventiveness. The history of the act is, however, a relevant factor to be considered when confronted, as we are here, with an effort to include for the first time the residential landlord-tenant relationship within the 2V2-decade-old Consumer Protection Act aimed at abuses in \"trade\" and \"commerce\".\\nSecond, the respective rights and duties of residential tenants and landlords are spelled out in great detail, and an array of specific remedies provided for violations thereof, in a single comprehensive enactment, the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18. Nothing in that enactment purports to give the Attorney General any enforcement authority for violations of it.\\nExhaustive efforts on the part of concerned parties and legislators went into the drafting and enactment of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973. This work included the following: unsuccessfu...   \n",
       "865  (Italics ours.) Plaintiff's proposed instruction 2.\\nThe trial court refused to give the proposed instruction and gave the following instruction instead:\\nThe plaintiff claims that the defendant was negligent in:\\nThat the defendant knew or should have known the venting pipe was hot and could cause injury and he failed to give warning of the condition.\\nThe plaintiff claims that this was a proximate cause of injuries and damage to plaintiff. The defendant denies this claim.\\nThe defendant claims that the plaintiff was negligent for causing her own injuries by tripping over an object which was open and obvious. The plaintiff denies this claim.\\n(Italics ours.) Instruction 4. Aspon's counsel proposed that this instruction be changed to indicate that the landlord had a duty not only to warn of the condition of the pipe, but also to make it safe, once he had notice and an opportunity to repair it. The court refused to include the proposed changes.\\nAt trial, both parties introduced photographs showing Aspon's...   \n",
       "866   restricted to those duties enumerated in the statute.\\nIn 1973, concurrent with the Legislature's passage of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, the Washington Supreme Court recognized the theory of an implied warranty of habitability, and held that breach of the implied warranty is a valid defense in an unlawful detainer action. Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wn.2d 22, 28, 515 P.2d 160 (1973). The court reasoned that \"[a]ny realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant's promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord's promise to provide a liveable dwelling.\" Foisy, at 27. The court commented that its decision was \"reinforced\" by the newly passed Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973. Foisy, at 28. Since the duty allegedly violated by the landlord in Foisy, compliance with housing codes, was encompassed by RCW 59.18.060(1), the decision provides no guidance as to the existence of duties not specifically enumerated in RCW 59.18.060.
